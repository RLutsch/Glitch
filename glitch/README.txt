A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/chasebank/pen/qZNLyx.

 There's some cool glitchy text effects on CodePen, but some have draw backs, like needing black backgrounds, or heavy use of blend modes.

This version is two of the better methods merged together, from [Justin](http://codepen.io/jmw/pen/azVZZY) and [Lucas Bebber](http://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/ypgql/), with some added stuff from me. Mostly the glow and getting it so it works on any colored background.

At some point I'd like to add some scan lines or noise. [Dirk Weber's](http://codepen.io/DirkWeber/pen/ArFvk/) approach has a bit of that going on.

But I'll save that for another day.
